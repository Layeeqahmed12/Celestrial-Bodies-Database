# Celestial Bodies Database

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a relational PostgreSQL database to model celestial bodies including galaxies, stars, planets, moons, and asteroids. The goal is to demonstrate database design principles and relational data modeling.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- PostgreSQL
- SQL
- pgAdmin / SQL Server Management Studio

## 📂 Database Design

The database schema includes:
- Galaxies
- Stars
- Planets
- Moons
- Asteroids

## 🗂 Schema Features
- Primary Keys
- Foreign Key Relationships
- Constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE)
- Normalized table structure

## 🔍 Implementation Details

### 1️⃣ Data Modeling
- Designed ER diagram
- Established relationships between entities
- Applied normalization principles

### 2️⃣ SQL Operations
- Inserted sample astronomical data
- Created relational joins between tables
- Executed aggregate queries for analysis

### 3️⃣ Sample Queries
- Retrieve all planets within a galaxy
- List moons belonging to a specific planet
- Count number of celestial bodies per galaxy

## 📈 Learning Outcomes
- Strong understanding of relational database concepts
- Practical experience with primary and foreign keys
- Improved SQL querying skills
- Hands-on experience with schema design
